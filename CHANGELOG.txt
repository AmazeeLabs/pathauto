***DRUPAL-4-5, DRUPAL-4-6 releases***
2005-5-15
  Fixed bug in user/blog bulk updates - need to ignore user 0.
  
2005-5-14
  Fixed bug when creating users if blog module is enabled - missing 
  argument.

2005-5-9
  Fixed bug in updating already-aliased content - "replace" option
  didn't work correctly.

2005-5-7
  Added depth parameter of '0' to taxonomy URLs, so feed URLs are
  generated correctly.
  Added 'supportsfeeds' to the settings hook, enabling implementors
  to indicate that feed aliases may be automatically generated for
  that content type.
  Restored automatic feed generation (had been disabled in the
  refactoring).
  Added option to control behavior when updating already-aliased
  content.
  Added version tracking (based on webform's version tracking). Will
  automatically fix up variable names that changed after the 2005-4-23
  release.

2005-4-30
  Refactoring of pathauto. Instead of building support for various
  content types directly into pathauto.module, we now use a modular
  design which allows support for different content types to be added
  without touching pathauto itself.

  Support for user and blog aliases.
  Conversion of accents and ligatures to ASCII equivalents.
2005-4-10
