***HEAD***
2005-7-3
  Added verbose option, to display alias change/create actions.
  Fixed problem with timed-out bulk updates "sticking" and trying to
    execute on all subsequent visits to the settings page.
  Switched to using vocabulary IDs instead of names in pattern vars.
  Added support for forum aliasing to pathauto_taxonomy.inc.
  Put API documentation into separate file.

***DRUPAL-4-6 only***
2005-6-26
  Index aliases now only generated for nodes - bulk update creation
  for other content types was broken.

2005-6-25
  Implemented generation of index aliases.
  [bookpath] placeholder added.
  Fix issue with taxonomy aliases using depth parameters not being
  used in the outgoing direction.
2005-6-6
  Fix bug with empty separator

***DRUPAL-4-5 only***
2005-5-23
  drupal_get_path replaced with module_get_path

***DRUPAL-4-5, DRUPAL-4-6 releases***
2005-5-15
  Fixed bug in user/blog bulk updates - need to ignore user 0.
  
2005-5-14
  Fixed bug when creating users if blog module is enabled - missing 
  argument.

2005-5-9
  Fixed bug in updating already-aliased content - "replace" option
  didn't work correctly.

2005-5-7
  Added depth parameter of '0' to taxonomy URLs, so feed URLs are
  generated correctly.
  Added 'supportsfeeds' to the settings hook, enabling implementors
  to indicate that feed aliases may be automatically generated for
  that content type.
  Restored automatic feed generation (had been disabled in the
  refactoring).
  Added option to control behavior when updating already-aliased
  content.
  Added version tracking (based on webform's version tracking). Will
  automatically fix up variable names that changed after the 2005-4-23
  release.

2005-4-30
  Refactoring of pathauto. Instead of building support for various
  content types directly into pathauto.module, we now use a modular
  design which allows support for different content types to be added
  without touching pathauto itself.

2005-4-23
  Support for user and blog aliases.
  Conversion of accents and ligatures to ASCII equivalents.
2005-4-10
  Support for node-specific patterns

2005-4-2
  [type] and [book] placeholders added.

  Initial merger of Mike Ryan's autopath with Tommy Sundstrom's 
  path_automatic.
